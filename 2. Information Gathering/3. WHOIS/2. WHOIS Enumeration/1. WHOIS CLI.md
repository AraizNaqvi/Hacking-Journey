The `whois` command is a powerful tool for querying domain registration information, which can give insights into ownership, registration dates, name servers, and more. Here's an overview of how to use it and what you can do:

### Basic Usage
1. **Simple Query for a Domain**
   ```bash
   whois example.com
   ```
   This provides the standard WHOIS information for the domain, such as:
   - Registrar information
   - Registrant contact details (if not privacy-protected)
   - Registration and expiration dates
   - Name servers
   - Domain status (e.g., clientTransferProhibited)

2. **Query for an IP Address**
   ```bash
   whois 192.168.1.1
   ```
   For IP addresses, WHOIS shows the regional internet registry (RIR) details, which could include:
   - Network owner
   - Assigned ranges
   - Contact information for the organization

### Advanced Options and Flags
3. **Specify a WHOIS Server**
   ```bash
   whois -h whois.verisign-grs.com example.com
   ```
- If you want to query a specific WHOIS server directly, this flag allows you to override the default server for a more direct or authoritative response.

4. **Show Registrar-Specific Information**
   ```bash
   whois -r example.com
   ```
- Some WHOIS clients use the `-r` option to fetch only registrar-specific information.

5. **Query Output in Verbose Mode (if supported)**
   ```bash
   whois -v example.com
   ```
- The `-v` flag can be used to produce more verbose output, though this is not supported on all whois clients. It’s useful for getting detailed server responses.

6. **Using WHOIS with Grep**
   ```bash
   whois example.com | grep -i 'creation date'
   ```
- Use `grep` to filter specific fields, such as creation date, expiration date, or registrar name, which is helpful when you’re looking for only certain details in the output.

7. **Limiting Data with `--raw` (or equivalent)**
   ```bash
   whois --raw example.com
   ```
- This outputs raw WHOIS data as received directly from the server, without extra formatting.
