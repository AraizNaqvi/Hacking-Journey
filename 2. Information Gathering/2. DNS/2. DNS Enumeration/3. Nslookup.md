`nslookup` is another powerful tool used for querying DNS records, and while it shares some similarities with `host`, it offers additional flexibility and options. Let's break down how to use `nslookup` in detail:

### **Getting Started with nslookup**

`nslookup` is a command-line tool available on most operating systems that allows you to query DNS servers to obtain domain name or IP address mapping information. It can be used interactively or with single commands. 

You can use `nslookup` in **two modes**:
1. **Interactive mode**: Allows you to enter multiple queries without retyping `nslookup` each time.
2. **Non-interactive mode**: Allows you to run a single DNS query and get results in one line.

### **Basic Usage (Non-Interactive Mode)**
```bash
nslookup <domain_name>
```
Example:
```bash
nslookup example.com
```
Output (example):
```bash
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  192.168.1.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Addresses:  151.101.1.195
          151.101.65.195
          151.101.193.195
          151.101.129.195
```
- **Server**: The DNS server being used to resolve the domain.
- **Non-authoritative answer**: Indicates that the answer is not directly from the authoritative DNS server for the domain, but from a cache.
- **Name**: The domain being queried.
- **Addresses**: The IP addresses associated with the domain.

### **Interactive Mode**
To enter interactive mode, just type `nslookup` without a domain name:
```bash
nslookup
```
Now you can enter multiple commands interactively without needing to type `nslookup` again.

Example:
```bash
> nslookup
> set type=MX
> transferwise.com
```

### **Common Commands and Options in nslookup**

1. **Set Query Type**
   - By default, `nslookup` queries for A records (IPv4 addresses). You can change the type of query to ask for other DNS record types (e.g., MX, CNAME, NS, SOA).
   - Command:
     ```bash
     set type=<record_type>
     ```
   - Examples:
     - `set type=MX`: Queries for mail exchange servers.
     - `set type=NS`: Queries for name servers.
     - `set type=A`: Queries for the A record (IPv4 address).
     - `set type=AAAA`: Queries for IPv6 addresses.
     - `set type=SOA`: Queries for the Start of Authority (SOA) record.

     Example:
     ```bash
     > set type=MX
     > example.com
     ```

2. **Set the DNS Server**
   - You can specify a particular DNS server to use for your query:
     ```bash
     server <dns_server>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     > server 8.8.8.8
     > example.com
     ```

3. **Querying Reverse DNS (PTR Records)**
   - You can perform a reverse DNS lookup to find the domain associated with an IP address by querying PTR records.
   - Command:
     ```bash
     nslookup <IP_address>
     ```

     Example:
     ```bash
     nslookup 151.101.1.195
     ```

4. **Querying Specific Records**
   - You can use `nslookup` to query for specific records directly:
     - A record:
       ```bash
       nslookup example.com
       ```
     - MX record (Mail exchange):
       ```bash
       nslookup -type=MX example.com
       ```
     - NS record (Name servers):
       ```bash
       nslookup -type=NS example.com
       ```
     - SOA record (Start of Authority):
       ```bash
       nslookup -type=SOA example.com
       ```

5. **Debugging Queries**
   - To view detailed information about the query, including query time and more, you can enable the `debug` mode.
   - Command:
     ```bash
     set debug
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     > set debug
     > example.com
     ```

6. **Timeout and Retries**
   - You can adjust the timeout (how long to wait for a response) and the number of retries with:
     ```bash
     set timeout=<seconds>
     set retries=<count>
     ```

### **Advanced Techniques**

1. **Zone Transfers**: Try to perform a zone transfer if misconfigured:
   - Command: `set type=AXFR` (zone transfer).
   - Example: 
     ```bash
     nslookup -type=AXFR example.com
     ```
   If a DNS server allows unauthorized zone transfers, you'll get a complete list of all DNS records for that domain, which can be very valuable for reconnaissance.
