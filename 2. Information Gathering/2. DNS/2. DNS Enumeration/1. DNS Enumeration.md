With DNS Enumeration, as a hacker you'd generally try to map a network's online infrastructure. This is all the DNS records in its zone file.
This includes:

1. A Records
	- Helps find IPV4 Addresses of critical servers and check if they're online
	- Use this to scan open ports and vulnerabilities
1. AAAA Records
	- Helps find IPV6 Addresses of critical servers and check if they're online
	- Use this to scan open ports and vulnerabilities
2. MX Records
	- Helps identify email servers.
	- Knowing email servers allows hackers to tailor phishing attacks or tests on these email services.
3. NS Records
	- The authoritative name-servers may be probed for mis-configurations or vulnerabilities potentially allowing to redirect traffic or conduct DNS based attacks
4. CNAME Records
	- Provides subdomains and aliases which make up the online infrastructure.
	- Hackers could look for potential entry points or third party dependencies which are vulnerable.
5. SOA  Records
	- Admin data such as responsible email address can be used for social engineering attacks. Also, DNS timing attacks can be made just around DNS refresh schedules.


Tools to be used are:
- host (preferred)
- nslookup
- dig
