This is where DNS security is a big thing.

1. DoH or DNS over HTTPS.
	HTTPS is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure which uses encryption which makes it secure to use since it is encrypted. So, using DNS with HTTPS means your DNS becomes encrypted too.

	Your browser and DNS server needs to support DoH.
	Use tools like TwinGate to help your team get DNS security.

2. DoT or DNS over TLS
3. DNScrypt
4. DNSsec
5. DNS servers like Quad9
