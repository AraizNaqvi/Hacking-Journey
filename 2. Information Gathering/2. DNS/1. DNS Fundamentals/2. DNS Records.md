In the Zone File, there are:

1. A Records
	This part of the zone file holds DNS names to IPV4 addresses.
	This is what helps resolve names to IP Addresses. Also, has the TTL which tells us how long each record is valid until the next update.

2. Name Servers or NS Record
	Tells us what Authoritative DNS server is responsible for a second level domain.

3. AAAA Records
	This is same as A records but for IPV6.

4. MX Records
	They identify what servers for that domain handles emails.
	When you type an email to that domain like subscriptions@linkedin.com then it has to figure out who manages the emails for the network linkedin.com, so here you would get what server handles it.

5. PTR Records
	Pointer records help to take an IP Address and say which Domain Name belongs to this IP Address.
	Help to avoid email spams.

6. CNAME Records
	A Canonical Name Record is used when you use alias'. This means that if you give an alias name it resolves it to the canonical one or the real one.
	**Read CNAME additional IMPORTANT**.

7. TXT Records
	These are text records. Admins leave notes or say comments.
	They are vital in how we secure emails.

8. SOA Records
	Stands for Start of Authority. It stores admin information about a DNS zones.
	DNS zones are used for manageability purposes, say, if there are three subdomains namely:
	1. shop.example.com
	2. blog.example.com
	3. support.example.com

	Suppose, shop and blog have a few computers on it, but support has a huge number of computers on it. Then DNS zones are allocated, say, shop and blog go in DNS Zone 1 and support goes int DNS zone 2.

	Now, these SOA records hold the following:
	1. MNAME: Primary Name Server
	2. RNAME: Email address of admin assigned to that zone, where '.' represents @.
	3. SERIAL: represents a version, so whenever, it changes, updates have been made.

9. SRV Record
	Stands for Service Record. This points to a server with a specific service at that port number. 

Task: Query secretmessage.networkchuck.com using a DNS querying tool and say what that secret message says.


### CNAME additional

Computers read domain names from right to left.
The domain names will have several parts:

In example.com,
#### Root Domain
There is a dot right after com which is hidden.
This dot if visible might look like example.com., this dot is the Root Domain

#### Top Level Domain
.com is the TLD.

#### Second Level Domain
example is a SLD.

#### Subdomain
www. is the Subdomain.
Are also used when different services run on the same server and use the same IP Address.
Say FTP service runs on the same server, then they can create a subdomain, say, ftp.example.com and have a CNAME redirected to the actual domain.

Now, the actual domain name is example.com, however, if someone types www.example.com, then it should redirect to example.com, this is where CNAME records come in.
