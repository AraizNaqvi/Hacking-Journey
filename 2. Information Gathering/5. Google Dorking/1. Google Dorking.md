Google Dorking uses Google to find files and systems that are not secure or information that has been made public by accident.
Example: Passwords, Security Cameras, etc.

Using the right keywords you can find critical information.
There are several Keywords and Operators used in the process.

Keywords used are:

1. `"<search here>"`
	Put anything in quotation marks and it will return it to you.
	Usage: `"bat"`

	Now, there is going to be one issue, when you do so it might return to you more of the animal bat, however, you're looking for the cricket bat. This is where you can use other operators in conjunction with "" as follows:
	Usage: `"bat" -animal`

2. `site:`
	Filter results to a certain website.
	Usage: `gaming laptops site:amazon.com`

3. `inurl:`
	Filter results to all webpages who's URL's contain that keyword.
	Usage: `site:amazon.com inurl:admin`
	Hackers use this to find websites that the organisation does not want you to see, so you can find vulnerabilities to attack.
	
	Another use can be if you're searching for websites using http and not https, you can do it as:
	usage: `site:amazon.com inurl:http`

4. `intext:`
	Filters results to all webpages who's bodies contain that keyword.
	Usage: `site:amazon.com intext:password`
	Hackers once again can use this to find websites that the organisation does not want you to see, so you can find vulnerabilities to attack.

5. `intitle:`
	Filters results to all webpages who's titles contain that keyword.
	Usage: `site:amazon.com intitle:password`
	Hackers once again can use this to find websites that the organisation does not want you to see, so you can find vulnerabilities to attack.

6. `filetype:`
	Filter all publicly available files of that particular file type.
	Usage: `site:amazon.com filetype:pdf`
	Hackers can access documents, summaries, logs, etc which were not meant to be public and use it as a vulnerability. Suppose, you find a document holding employee names and social handles, hackers can use it to prove themselves in social engineering attacks.

7. `allintext:`
	Filters for a certain text in every text in that webpage.
	Usage: `allintext:password`
	
	You can also use it with filetype and after to get more critical information:
	Usage: `allintext:password filetype:log after:2018`

You can also find information on a certain individual like:
`"David Benjamin" filetype:pdf OR filetype:xlsx OR filetype:docs`
Use this gain access.


You may also refer to Google Hacking Database is a website where people have posted potential search vulnerabilities that can be used.

Also, in order to not have to memorise all those search terms, use **PaGoDo** or **Passive Google Dork** which shows some errors but i'll figure it out later. However, you can use the dork files in pagodo to make search terms.

### Key Google Dorking Operators and Syntax

#### 1. **`site:`** – Limits the search to a specific website or domain.
   - Example: `site:example.com`
   - Use case: To find all pages indexed from a particular domain.

#### 2. **`filetype:`** – Searches for specific file types.
   - Example: `filetype:pdf`
   - Use case: To find documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc., indexed by Google. Combined with `site:`, this is useful for finding files on a specific domain.

#### 3. **`intitle:`** – Searches for specific keywords within the title of a page.
   - Example: `intitle:"index of"`
   - Use case: Used for finding directory listings, which may expose files or directories.

#### 4. **`inurl:`** – Looks for specific keywords in URLs.
   - Example: `inurl:admin`
   - Use case: Useful for finding admin pages, login portals, or specific endpoints on a website.

#### 5. **`allintext:` and `intext:`** – Searches for keywords within the body text of a page.
   - Example: `allintext:password`
   - Use case: To search for pages containing sensitive information directly in the text.

#### 6. **`cache:`** – Views the cached version of a page that Google has stored.
   - Example: `cache:example.com`
   - Use case: To see an older version of a page that might still have sensitive information.

#### 7. **`related:`** – Finds sites similar to the given URL.
   - Example: `related:example.com`
   - Use case: Good for identifying competitors or similar websites.

#### 8. **`-` (Minus)** – Excludes terms from search results.
   - Example: `site:example.com -filetype:pdf`
   - Use case: Useful to narrow down results by excluding unwanted types or terms.

### Example Google Dorks for Security and Information Gathering

#### 1. **Finding Exposed Directories**
   ```plaintext
   intitle:"index of" "backup"
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Searches for directories titled "index of" with "backup" in the title or body. Exposed backup directories can contain sensitive files.

#### 2. **Finding Login Portals**
   ```plaintext
   inurl:login OR inurl:admin
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Locates login pages on a website, which is useful during reconnaissance for finding entry points.

#### 3. **Discovering Exposed Files**
   ```plaintext
   site:example.com filetype:xls OR filetype:doc OR filetype:pdf
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Searches for Excel, Word, or PDF documents specifically on `example.com`, often useful for locating public documents that may contain internal information.

#### 4. **Finding Email Addresses**
   ```plaintext
   site:example.com intext:@example.com
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This finds email addresses within the content of pages on `example.com`. Useful for gathering contact details for OSINT.

#### 5. **Sensitive Information (Passwords, Logs, etc.)**
   ```plaintext
   allintext:username filetype:log
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Attempts to find exposed log files containing usernames, which may contain sensitive information.

#### 6. **Exposing Server Configurations**
   ```plaintext
   intitle:"Apache Status" OR intitle:"NGINX Status"
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Finds status pages of web servers, which may reveal details about the server setup, active connections, and performance.

#### 7. **Using Google for Security Testing**
   - **Search Query**: `site:example.com inurl:"phpinfo.php"`
   - **Purpose**: PHP’s `phpinfo.php` file provides detailed server environment information and can be exposed by misconfiguration. This is an example of how Google Dorking can identify specific files that should be restricted.
