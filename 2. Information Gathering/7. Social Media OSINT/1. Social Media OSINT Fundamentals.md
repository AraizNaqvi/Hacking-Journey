Social Media OSINT is basically gathering all publicly available information from social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, X, Instagram, etc to use this information for recon purposes.


### Why SMINT is important for Hackers?

- Social Media provides a lot of user generated content that is often unregulated and candid. This can uncover details about individuals or organisations that are not publicly available elsewhere.
- Some data found from SMINT can be used to increase the attack surface by identifying potential entry points such as employee email addresses, insider knowledge or weak links.
- Personalized phishing attacks are more likely to strike
- LinkedIn SMINT can help hackers map out organisation structures and roles which aids in phishing and privilege escalation attempts.


### How Real Hackers use SMINT

Hackers would use Social Media in the following ways:

1. Target Identification
	- Linkedin: Identify employees, roles and email patterns
	- Facebook/Instagram: Provides personal details, habits and hobbies that can aid social engineering
	- X: Monitor public discussions, grievances or technology stack mentioned by employees.

2. Gathering Email Addresses
	You can try to understand the email address of the target organisation.

3. Mapping Connections
	Platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook can help hackers map out relationships between employees and departments.

4. Monitoring Activity
	Look for:
	- Internal Tools or Systems used like say AWS
	- Technologies used like Slack
	- Complaints about IT issues

5. Exploiting Oversharing
	- Passwords
	- Internal URL's
	- Internal Documents


### How you as a hacker can use this information?

Hackers will use this information in the following ways:

- Personalized details used to create convincing phishing emails or messages.
- Hobbies, pet names, personal and family details can be used to guess passwords.
- Identify admins or executives with higher access privileges for targeted attacks
- Impersonate trusted colleagues or partners to gain access to internal systems.
- Combine data with other reconnaisance techniques to build a complete picture of the target's network.
