Infrastructure Identification is used in recon to understand the underlying technologies used at your targets organisation.
You can get to understand the technology stack the target organisation uses, such as web servers, OS' and other third party services.


### Why it is used?

Understanding the tech stack by getting to know what software and frameworks are used helps to identify vulnerabilities associated with those technologies.
This can help determine what tools and exploits can be used on the target system.


### What can be done with this information?

- Exploit known vulnerabilities
- Craft targeted exploits
- Map the attack surface
- Social Engineer


### Real-Life Ethical Hacking Use Case

#### **Scenario: Small E-commerce Website**

1. **Tool Used:** WhatWeb
    - Detects the web server (Apache 2.4.29) and CMS (Magento 1.9.4).
2. **Action Taken:**
    - Research shows Magento 1.9.4 is outdated and has vulnerabilities.
    - Focus is placed on testing those vulnerabilities using tools like `Metasploit` or manual exploitation.
3. **Outcome:**
    - Identified a SQL injection vulnerability in an older plugin
