A ping scan is not always an ICMP ping.
In cases where a Ping Scan is used on a local network, Nmap uses the ARP to discover network devices. However, for devices on the internet, Nmap uses TCP ports 80 and 443 to make a ping scan.

If the *Ping Scan* is done without using privileged mode, then it is all TCP.
By default it uses a ping scan since some devices and their Firewalls or just devices in a secured network are not allowed to respond to ICMP pings. Also, since not al devices respond to ICMP so Nmap may incorrectly show them as down.

However, in order to actually get ICMP pings we need root privileges.
