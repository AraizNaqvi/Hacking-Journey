This is used to scan the Top 20 Most Commonly used ports on target IP.
It is used since:
- Faster Recon, since scanning 20 most commonly used ports is better than 65535.
- These top ports correspond to High Value Targets.
- By limiting number of ports, scan is less likely to trigger IDS/IPS systems.
- Results help decide which services to investigate further/exploit.


### Usage

Used as follows:
```
nmap --top-ports 20 192.168.192.32
```

`--top-ports` ~ This is followed by a number which denotes how many of the top ports are to be scanned at a certain IP Address.
