Using Nmap you can scan a certain Host, Subent or IP Range.
Done as follows:

### 1. Scanning a known Host

Using this you can scan the network of a known host.
**Input:**
```
x@y:~$ nmap scanme.nmap.org
```

**Output:**
```
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-22 23:11 IST
Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 138.18 seconds
```


### 2. Scanning a Subnet

This allows you to scan a certain subnet.
You can first check your local network using the `ifconfig` command as follows or have your target computers IP Range:

```
x@y:~$ ifconfig
```

Output:
```
alice@ItHere:~$ ifconfig
lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 4221022  bytes 211387611 (211.3 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 4221022  bytes 211387611 (211.3 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

wlo1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet [REDACTED]  netmask [REDACTED]  broadcast [REDACTED]
        inet6 [REDACTED]  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 [REDACTED]  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        inet6 [REDACTED]  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        ether [REDACTED]  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 328168  bytes 405529963 (405.5 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 99725  bytes 17600152 (17.6 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 9 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```


Once you know your current local IP Address, you can use the nmap scan with a subnet that your device is in as follows:

```
alice@ItHere:~$ nmap 192.168.192.0/24
```

Additionally, you can also scan a group of subnets. This is done as follows:

```
alice@ItHere:~$ nmap 127.0.0.0/8 192.168.192.0/24
```


### 3. Scanning an IP Range

This allows you to scan a certain IP Range in your local network or in target's network.
Done as follows:

```
alice@ItHere:~$ nmap 192.168.192.30-40
```
