Scanning ports allows us to know which ones are open, upon which we can scan for vulnerabilities.
In order to scan for ports, we can do any of the following:

### 1. Scanning Certain Ports

In order to scan certain ports, you can use Nmap.
This can be done as follows:

```
alice@ItHere:~$ nmap -p80,443 192.168.192.32
```


### 2. Scanning a Range of Ports

To scan a certain range, if you are aware of what needs to be scanned.
Done as follows:

```
alice@ItHere:~$ nmap -p1-100 192.168.192.32
```


### 3. Scanning all 65535 Ports

We can scan all 65535 ports of a certain IP address as follows:

```
alice@ItHere:~$ nmap -p- 192.168.192.32
```


### 4. Scanning Certain Ports using UDP

By default, scan is done over TCP. But if we need to scan for ports over UDP we use the `-sU` command.
Done as follows:

```
alice@ItHere:~$ sudo nmap -p80,443 -sU 192.168.192.32
```
