Nmap can be used to detect active hosts by using the *No Port Scan* since we don't search for ports we simply ping all IP's to see which one returns response.

It is usually the first step of the scanning process cause:
- It helps us identify live hosts.
- Minimizes the chances of triggering an IDS/IPS since we will only target live hosts.
- Prevents wasting resources scanning all devices on network.

### Usage

Used as follows:
```
nmap -sn 192.168.16.0/24
```
`-sn` ~ this flag tells Nmap to perform a 'No Port Scan'. This simply checks live hosts.

This will return all devices that are live with host names and IP Addresses.
