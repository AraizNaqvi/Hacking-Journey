Here we try to make our Nmap scans faster.
There are are something called Timing Templates, these decide how fast or how slow your scans map the target.

There are stages to these Timing Templates. They are:
1. T0 : Paranoid
2. T1 : Sneaky
3. T2 : Polite
4. T3 : Normal
5. T4 : Aggressive
6. T5 : Insane

The default timing template is T3.
Being slow helps us evade detection by a firewall or its IPS/IDS.

### Usage

```
nmap scanme.nmap.org -T4
```


The best practices for optimal scan performance are:
1. Get the live hosts.
2. Avoid certain ports and scan important ports.
3. Try to be as specific as possible.
4. When running a scan using the -sn is best cause it avoids scanning a lot of ports.
5. Avoid -A and -O as much as possible
