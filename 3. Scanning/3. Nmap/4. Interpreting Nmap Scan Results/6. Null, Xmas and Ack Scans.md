## **Null Scan**

The null scans are the scans that are as the name suggests, null.
Usually, TCP scans set a certain flag like SYN, ACK, SYN ACK, RST, etc but in the case of Null Scans it does set any flag and it shows as None.

### Usage

```
nmap -sN scanme.nmap.org
```


## **Christmas Scan**

The Christmas scan sets up a FIN, PSH and URG flags.

### Usage

```
nmap -sX scanme.nmap.org
```


## FIN Scan

The FIN scan sets up the FIN scan.

### Usage

```
nmap -sF scanme.nmap.org
```


The main reason to use these scans was to take advantage of the TCP RFC if it was implimented and bypass firewalls. FIN is simply the goodbye there was no hello!

However, it is important to know that these scans don't work well anymore cause Firewalls directly kill them.
