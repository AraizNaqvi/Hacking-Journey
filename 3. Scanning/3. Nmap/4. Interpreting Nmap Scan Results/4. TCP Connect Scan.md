TCP connect scan is when Nmap gives a connect instruction to the TCP stack of the device of the device that is making a scan.
These are also stealthy cause they look just like a normal connection that usual devices make. However, as compared to a stealth scan they complete the TCP handshake.


### **Usage**

```
nmap -sT scanme.nmap.org
```

`-sT` ~ TCP scan
