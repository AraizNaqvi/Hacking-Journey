The Nmap stealth scan works in the way where it initiates a SYN Flag.
This is followed by the SYN ACK flag by the target to you. Then instead of returning an ACK you return a RST. The handshake is simply reset.

### Usage

Used as follows:
```
sudo nmap -sS scanme.nmap.org
```

`-sS` ~ Stands for Stealth Scan.


### Why the Stealth Scan can be easily detected?

Any blue teaming team will notice a packet wherein in the SYN flag of any request which is abruptly ended with a RST flag look for the window size and MSS.

MSS is determined by the maximum size of packet that the network can efficiently handle typically from 536 bytes to 1460 bytes. While, the Window Size is how much data can be in-flight at any given time which is about 65,535 bytes for the before given MSS.

This is why we can catch a Nmap sS:
- Nmap uses a small window size (<=1025 bytes) which is not usual since Window Sizes are usually > MSS
- SYN followed by RST
