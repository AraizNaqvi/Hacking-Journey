We can select which ports to scan.
This is done via the -p flag or we can also use the --top-ports.
If we do -F we do the top 100 ports.

### Usage

### 1. Scanning specific ports

In order to scan a certain port, we can do:
```
nmap -p80 scanme.nmap.org
```

In order to scan a range of ports, we can do:
```
nmap -p1-100 scanme.nmap.org
```

In order to do all ports, we can do:
```
nmap -p- scanme.nmap.org
```


### 2. Top Ports

In order to scan certain number of top ports, we can do:
```
nmap --top-ports 20 scanme.nmap.org
```
