When a scan is done, we get ports and there are 6 different states that can come through.
These states are:

1. Open
	This state is accepting TCP/UDP connections wherein you receive a SYN ACK in response.

2. Closed
	A closed state is accessible since it receives and responds to Nmap probes or SYN flags but there is no application listening on it. They respond with RST ACK.
	They are online and can be used for additional scanning.

3. Filtered
	Filtered state shows that no response came back. This is usually by firewalls that don't want to give you a hint whether the port is open.

4. Unfiltered
	Unfiltered state means that a port is accessible but Nmap is not able to determine whether the port is open/closed.
	This state is only classified by the `-sA` or the ACK scan.

The other two are open/filtered and closed/filtered which are extremely rare.
