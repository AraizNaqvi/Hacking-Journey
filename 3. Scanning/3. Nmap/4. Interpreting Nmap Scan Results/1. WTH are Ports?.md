Since we talk a lot about ports. Think of ports as a door. When this door opens you gain access. Some are locked some are open, some used to be there, while now some are bricked up.

They are a software socket that gives us access to that device and then an application can support that port and we access that server using that port.
There are 65535 total ports on a device. 

This helps us know that a service/appication is using that port, we can find what is using it and what vulneribilities are there.
