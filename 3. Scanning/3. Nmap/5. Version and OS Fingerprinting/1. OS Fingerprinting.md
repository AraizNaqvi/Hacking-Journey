Nmap can help us understand the OS of the target.
The more accurately we know the OS, the better we can plan the attack.

### Usage

```
sudo nmap -O scanme.nmap.org
```

`-O` ~ OS fingerprinting


### But what happens at the packet level?

There are a whole bunch of SYN and RST flags all over.
But if you filter for `tcp.port == 80`, you will see that it sends a certain request and looks for what the other side does and based on that determines the OS.
