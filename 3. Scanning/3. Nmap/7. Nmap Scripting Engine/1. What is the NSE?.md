The Nmap Scripting Engine allows us to automate scans.
So, instead of sitting around doing all your scan work manually, it's better to use automated scripting.

You can automate:
1. Network Discovery
2. More sophisticated version detection
3. Vulnerability Detection
4. Backdoor Detection
5. Vulnerability Exploitation

The only problem is that they are quite noisy and make you more visible.
Go to `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`
They are written in the Lua programming language.
