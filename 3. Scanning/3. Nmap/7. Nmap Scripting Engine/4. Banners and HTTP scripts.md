We can see all banners related to that specific target.
Say as we do:
```
nmap --script "banner" scanme.nmap.org
```

Using http-methods, we can see what type of requests the server accepts, like GET, POST, etc. 
This is done as:
```
nmap --script "http-methods" scanme.nmap.org
```

You can go through all 'http' scripts using `ls | grep "http"`
