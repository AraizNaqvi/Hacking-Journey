There are a list of default scripts wherein most run automatically.
This is done as:
```
nmap -sC scanme.nmap.org
```

or this can be done as:
```
nmap --script=default scanme.nmap.org
```

Supposd, we need to run some specific script. We can do this using the --script flag as follows:
```
nmap --script "http-auth" scanme.nmap.org
```

Now, if say I want to run through all FTP server scripts to get as much information on their FTP as possible:
```
nmap --script "ftp-*" scanme.nmap.org
```
