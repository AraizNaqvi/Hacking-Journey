Using a Capture Filter depends on how well you know what you're searching for, for example, when you know the exact specifics of a certain issue or packet you're tapping the wire for.
However, still there's a chance that you might lose important packets that were otherwise lost when you used a Capture Filter.

It is better preferred to capture all packets and then use Display Filters to filter packets individually based on a certain condition. So, in this way, you don't risk losing anything.
