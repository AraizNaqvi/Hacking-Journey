At the start page UI wherein I can set *Capture Options* which is basically from where I can set options for which interfaces i'd like to use, usually I would select options that are more likely to be used like wlan. 

There's a whole bunch of different options to choose but that usually you would use in a real sensitive environment, otherwise, default settings after choosing interfaces you'd like to capture on is selected.
