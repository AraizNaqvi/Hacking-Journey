Most environments are *switched* , that means they are connected via switches.
Since switches traverse traffic down a specific port and don't broadcast, even if we set up our wireshark on the switch it will simply go from around us. 

So how do we deal with this?

1. The easiest way to capture is to directly capture at an end point. 
   Although, this does have its pros and cons. The biggest con is that a server is already very busy and over that you're sitting on it making it more difficult to work.

2. We can use SPAN/Mirror which is where we tell the switch to forward packets to a device I can capture on like a laptop.

3. You can simply put a tap between any two nodes in between the entire traffic. In this way you can easily understand the traffic going through it.
