TCP is a handshake or connection oriented protocol.

Suppose, there is a PC and a Server listening at port 80.
Now, TCP won't just throw a packet out there and hope it works. It makes sure everything is reliably transmitted and even if there are losses, it retransmits data.

The PC sends a SYN to server, this is where the PC says "Hello!"
Once the server gets the SYN it resends a server to the PC saying "Hey! I hear you!"
From here, the PC sends one last "Gotcha!" as an ACK to fininsh the 3 way handshake and can now reliably start transfering data.

TCP is a stateful protocol, which means endpoint is going to maintain state. Both devices are aware of each other. But, if one side shuts down, then we go to a different TCP state.
