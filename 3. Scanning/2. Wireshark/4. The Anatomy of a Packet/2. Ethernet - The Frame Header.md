The Ethernet frame packet format looks as [follows](https://sierrahardwaredesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IEEE-802_3-Basic-Ethernet-Frame-with-Source-Address-Field-Highlighted-e1711521388802-1024x409.png):

(ignore Preamble and SFD as of now)


First 6 Bytes are the Destination Address, next 6 bytes are the Source Address.
Followed by this is the Type that is an Ethertype Field which is a 2 bytes field that tells us the next layer (Network Layer) protocol, whether it is IPV4, IPV6, etc.
Next is 46-1500 Bytes of Data, that is the actual body.
In the end, there's a Frame Check Sequence which is a check sum and checks for correctness.

At the router, if the FCS does not match means there has been a *FCS Error* due to mismatch and potential data loss.

At the Ethernet Layer or Data Link Layer, the data is as Frames as we move up the stack Frames cut off to Packets and then to Segments in the Network and Transport layers respectfully.
