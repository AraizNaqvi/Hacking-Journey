So there's two models, OSI and TCP/IP which are basically the same, just TCP/IP is simplified.
For example: OSI can be saying all alphabets a, b, c, d, ... to refer to alphabets and TCP/IP directly refers it as alphabets.
In short, same things just simplified.

### OSI Model
7. Application
6. Presentation
5. Session
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link
1. Physical

### TCP/IP Model
5. Application
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link
1. Physical

Packets occur at the Network layer, they are routed from router to router to reach their destination.
