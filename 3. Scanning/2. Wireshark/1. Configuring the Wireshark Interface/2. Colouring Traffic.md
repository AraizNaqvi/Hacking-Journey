First, in order to filter traffic you're searching for, you can either memorise the filters (this comes with time) or commonly you're going to click on that option and on the bottom left it will tell you what filter key to use, then you can use that along with an operator to figure out what you're looking for.

Next, in order to save what you've filtered, you can simply click the '+' icon on top right and in case you've already entered a filter you will only need to give it a name, else also specify the filter and save.
This will allow easy access to filtering for that specific need.
Example: tcp.flags.syn == 1

In order to colour, you will need to click on View > Colouring Rules > '+' then set a Name and Filter. Next, at the bottom, add a background and foreground (text colour) to give it the colour of your choice.

You can also drag filters based on priority.
