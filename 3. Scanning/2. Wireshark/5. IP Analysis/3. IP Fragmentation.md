IP was designed to be able to fragment or break a packet so that routers that have Low Transmission Rates are able to break packets into smaller fragments before sending them out as fragments.

So what happens is, when you send a packet larger than the max size which is 1500 bytes, it's fragment bit is set to active and message is sent in parts.

The first one is received and the second one fills in the offset left.
So out of 1500, 20 bytes is header length, so offset of first fragment is set from 0-1480 and then for the next fragment which completes the packet.

In most cases, the do not fragment bit is set. This means in case a packet bigger than the MTU or the Maximum Transmission Unit arrives and it can't fragment it since the do not fragment bit is set to 1 then the packet is simply returned with an ICMP since it can't send a packet larger than MTU without fragmenting it.
