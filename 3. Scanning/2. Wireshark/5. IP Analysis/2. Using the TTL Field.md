You can use TTL to check how far away you are from your destination.
Usually, TTLs are either 64, 128 or 255 so accordingly you know.

Let's say if TTL says 118, obviously it has not come from 255 otherwise that would be a stupid massive number of routers it has hopped by to reach here.
Hence the starting TTL of that 118 was 128.

And so on.
