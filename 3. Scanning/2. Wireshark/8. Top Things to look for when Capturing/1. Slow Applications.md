The network is always blamed for everything.

As soon as you see a TCP, look at the Network Round Trip time, that is the time between Client to Server.
This number will tell you time it took for server to respond.

So, when you see a connection i.e. SYN ACK look for how much time the server took to respond. TCP Keep Alive when is relatively very large, you tend to understand that the application it taking a long time to respond.

If the response generally takes longer than 2 Seconds then you gotta look at it cause this denotes a Slow web server.
