Some common filters used:
- IPV4 Address: ip.addr == 10.0.0.1
- IPV4 Source: ip.src == 10.0.0.1
- IPV4 Range (Subnet): ip.addr == 10.0.0.0/24
- TCP Port: tcp.port == 80
- TCP SYNs: tcp.flags.syn == 1

Also, you get to understand when a filter is correct or incorrect.
When filter bar turns green means it is correct, red means incorrect and in the middle means partially correct/incorrect.
