Capture filters are simply the first page that shows up asking where do you wish to capture packets, wlan, Bluetooth, any, etc.
At this stage, if we apply filters it counts as capture filters.
Say across a certain network like wlan, I wish to only capture HTTP traffic then its called Capture Traffic.

But, once we start capturing traffic, then when we apply filters, that is called Display Filters, i.e. filtering traffic from within a capture.
