When a device leaves the factory all it knows is that its's got a burnt in MAC Address in it but other than that nothing really.

Devices are at source IP address of 0.0.0.0 and send out a request as a broadcast to all IPs in the subnet. They do have a source MAC address, however, they broadcast their destination MAC address.

The UDP is only 8 Bytes, this includes (2 bytes each):

1. Source Port
2. Destination Port
3. Length
4. Checksum

It just sends it out there and has no way of acknowledging.
UDP does not care about the payload.

It is called Discover, since it still does not have an IP and is still searching.
The only thing I've got is a Client MAC address.

At the Discover stage, device has the following in options:

1. DHCP message type: DISCOVER in this case
2. DHCP Client Identifier: The only thing I know about myself is the MAC
3. DHCP Requested IP: If the device has no history of communicating with the DHCP before it usually specified a length of 4 and 0.0.0.0 . If it were already assigned an IP earlier then it simply reminds the DHCP server to give it the same IP address as before.
4. DHCP Parameter Request List: This includes parameters like:
	- Subnet Mask
	- Router
	- DNS
	- Network Time Protocol Server
5. DHCP end

Now, it's not necessary that the server will provide all this but it's just what a normal request looks like.
