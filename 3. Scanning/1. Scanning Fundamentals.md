Scanning is performed on a much deeper level.
In Recon, we gathered emails, phones numbers, etc but in Scanning we will find as much as possible about our target's technological aspect.

You will scan to find vulnerabilities. We need to figure out in what way they are vulnerable and how. We will directly exchange packets with the target machine to find useful information. We will send TCP and UDP packets.

We are loking for Open Ports, on which their softwares are hosted. Everytime you visit that website you're visiting that port. There are a total of 65535 ports.

You can find all devices on your network using: 
- Netdiscover
- Nmap
You can look at all packets using:
- Wireshark
You can Scan using:
- Nmap
