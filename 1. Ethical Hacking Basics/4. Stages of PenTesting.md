Do we just magically attack targets?
At what stage do trojans, phishing, etc come in? All of these are very small portions of Hacking.

Before pentesting, it is important to understand what is within scope and what is out of scope. Have a good idea of what is within scope and what is not.
Always have permission to pentesting ;)

The different stages of pentesting:

1. Recon/Information Gathering
	Gathering information on your target to better plan out the attack.
	This is the only phase that can be done on anyone, since gathering openly available data of a target is not illegal.
	
	There are two categories of recon:
	
	1. Active
		By directly interacting with the target.
	
	2. Passive
		Getting information on a target from openly available information.

2. Scanning
	A deeper form of recon by actively understanding open ports and network infrastructure of the target. Also, finding vulnerabilities.

3. Gaining Access/Exploitation
	Gaining access is where the hack actually takes place. As soon as this occurs, you've successfully done the pentest.

4. Maintaing Access
	When you wish to access the target whenever we want without the need to exploit it again. This is done by planting a backdoor.

5. Covering Tracks
	Removing all evidence that an attack ever took place.
	Erasing all logs.
