### What is a Virtual Machine?

It is a machine within our physical computer that uses its hardware resources.

We all run OS', they're either Lunix, Windows or MacOS.
Now, if we want to run two different OS' on the same machine we use Virtual Machines.

You can imagine it as:
Divide the computer into parts wherein, one part includes the OS and the hardware components. Now, if need to run another OS we need to have hardware to support it.

This is what VM's do, they split the power of the physical machine to multiple machines.

Since we're hackers, we want to make sure we do our stuff in a safe environment. Suppose, we make errors and get infected how do we revert? We can literally delete our entire VM, hence problem solved!
We can also create a snapshot that acts as a VCS.


### How to create a VM?

We need:
1. OS
	The OS we wish to run.
	We will use Kali Linux.

2. Virtualization Software
	Helps us virtualize the OS we need.
